          <p><strong>Context:</strong> I led the research and development process for the Ellie seating project while working at ITO Design in Switzerland. Our strategic approach included the development of a wide range of customization options to accomodate new use environments such as home offices, co-working spaces and hot desking.</p>

          <h2>Research Findings</h2>
          <p>After a string of recent aquisitions, Flokk, a leading furniture company, tasked ITO Design with determining a new creative strategy for their latest partner, Profim. An indepth research and design process included market surveys at several trade shows and design workshops with stakeholders and Flokk and Profim. Key findings included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Office spaces exude an increasingly casual vibe with emphasis on comfort and collaboration</li>
            <li>Trends towards hot-desking and co-working mean that seating is often shared (but not properly adjusted) by multiple users per day.</li>
            <li>While ergonomics are the focus of task chairs at work, they are often overlooked in home offices where price, size and aesthetics are often more heavily weighted.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>New Product Requirements</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Limited adjustment without sacrificing ergonomic function</li>
            <li>Wide range of design options suitable to home AND office environments</li>
            <li>Avoid traditional ergonomic 'sitting machine' design language</li>
            <li>Acheive EN 1335 Type C Office Furniture Standard</li>
            <li>Accessible price point (under 400â‚¬)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Design Challenges</h2>
          <p>To design a seating family suitable to home and lounge environments, we wanted to move away from the typical 'sitting machine' ergonomic design language of most task chairs and create a soft and comfortable lounge aesthetic. This required the introduction of new (Sub-D) modeling software into our design process, that allowed the form to be shaped around a synchronized recline mechanism and housing. </p>
