          <h2>Hospital Supply Carts are Failing</h2>
          <p>Four separate site visits to hospitals were made to interview healthcare professionals and understand the challenges of the ICU (Intensive Care Unit)environment. During visits, I observed that nurses don‘t feel confident in the current supply system design and often have to improvise their own solutions to provide patient care. This leads to increased clutter and wasted supplies - upwards of $100 million annually in Canadian hospitals.</p>

          <h2>A New Model of Care</h2>
          <p>A recent procedural change in Canadian hospitals has helped to solve this problem. By moving supply storage to a ‚boat‘ outside the patient room, waste creation was reduced without comprimising supply access. The new model has been adopted with some success by the Ottawa Hospital ICUs, but, existing supply carts don‘t meet the constraints of the new space, resulting in increased clutter and added stress to hospital staff. </p>

          <h2>Key Insights from Research</h2>
          <p>A new use case was prototyped and optimized through interviews with medical staff. This storyboard was repeatidly updated with new findings throughout the design process.</p>
          <li>Nurses have their own creative ways of approaching patient care. Their work space should reconfigure and adapt easily to their individual needs.</li>
          <li>Contamination is usually caused unknowingly. Clearly marked sterile zones and high touch areas, and ensuring commonly used items are easily accessible will improve infection prevention and control.</li>

          <h2>User Testing & Co Design</h2>
          <p>Nurses and key stakeholders were invited to a mock ICU room and asked to perform common tasks using reconfigurable mock-ups. Together, new strategies for organizing, cleaning and resupplying the carts were developed and implemented into the new design.</p>

          <h2>Dialogue Supply Server</h2>
          <p>The proposed design for the new supply server addresses many of the issues relating to supply use under the new model of care in Canadian ICUs. Feedback from nurses and mentors was extremely positive, with Herman Miller taking note of my research for future internal studies into healthcare supply management. The work was awarded a Provost Scholarship for Academic Research at Carleton University in June 2016.</p>
